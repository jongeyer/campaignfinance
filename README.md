# Crossfiltering with Hawaii Campaign Finance Data


By looking at public data on state and county candidate contributions, expenditures, and disclosures published on [data.hawaii.gov](http://data.hawaii.gov) we can take a broad look at the amount of money influencing politics in Hawaiâ€˜i. Rather than focusing on individual candidates as has be done in (other places)[https://data.hawaii.gov/apps/campaignspending], I wanted to quickly compare different aspects of the data that can otherwise remain hidden.

Click anywhere on the graphs or bar charts below to quickly filter results.

If you know of other data that should be added to this please let me know.
